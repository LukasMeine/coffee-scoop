# Coffee scoop

Coffee Scoop is a plugin intended for personal, agency or whatever sites where you want to display some neat statistics.

These statistics are automatically retrieved from your public github profile.

__Usage:__

    $('#element').scoop(coffeeMugs,githubUsername);
    
__Why coffee scoop?__ Because it retrieves your data, puts it in a scoop and then brew it into something cool.
